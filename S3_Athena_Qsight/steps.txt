A practice project for hands-on AWS practice
Used Athena for analytics, S3 for data storage and Quick Sight for visualization


Step1: Create a S3 bucket and pull the data into it from data source (CSV here)
Step2: Create a DataBase  in a new Query in Athena to pull your data into Athena from S3. The Columns should match the columns from S3
        select the data source location in Athena
        
Step 3: Integrate Athena to QuickSight
         QuickSight: New Dataset source from Athena-> the name -> validate SSL -> use SPICE for snapshot of sata
         click visualize. Add visuals and graphs types (select X-Axis and Y-Axis) and thats it. 
         
Simple and neat project to just get started in AWS analytics and understanding the integration of services.
